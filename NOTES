Debated a long time about what to do about "build metadata".
At issue is the fact that is almost entirely information that
the end-user never needs to see, so it does not need to be
shipped with the package(s). By regulat metadata, in general
does. So this build data doesn't belong in the same location
as the regular metadata --with one excpetion. Build requirements
to actually compile and install the pacakge are needed.

After much consideration I have decided that such build requirements
should be included in the regular requirements field when
they are needed to compile and/or install.

As for the rest, I have for now at least declared a YAGNI.
The build fields would only act as defaults for other tools in
anycase. One might as well provided the configuration settings
for the tools themselves (e.g. setting them in a Rakefile).

Today I have finally decided that a Wiki is the best place
to keep user documentation. There is of course the obvious
advantage to this: online access, editable by any user, anywhere
at anytime. There are some subtle advantages as well. For instance,
I get automatic spell-checking via my browser.

Of course the big disadvantage is that should the Wiki Host
go kaputz, then no more documentation. I trust GitHub is not
going anywhere anytime soon, but I have had such a thing happen
to me before so I will be sure to look into making backups just in case.
