== Generate POM Metadata form README

We generate the metadata from the README using the pom command.

  system "pom < fixture/README1.txt"

Now lets vrify the metadata was extracted as expected.

  require 'pom/metadata'

  metadata = POM::Metadata.new

  metadata.title.assert == "MyApp"
  metadata.description.assert == "This is the description for the example."
  metadata.license.assert == "GPL"

Clean-up the generated directory.

  #FielUtils.rm_r('meta')

QED.
