== DESCRIPTION

Ruby POM stands for Ruby Project Object Model.
POM provides a metadata system for Ruby projects.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Standardizes common project metadata.
* Uses meta directory files for properties.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

Usage is fairly straight forward. The broadest use is to create a
Project object  passing the constructor the root directory of the project.

  project = POM::Project.new(root_dir)

The Project class ties into the rest of the system. Eg.

  project.metadata

Alternately you can utilize only specific parts of the system. For
instance, by creating a POM::Metadata object.

  metadata = POM::Metadata.new(root_dir)

Then you can query information from the project via method calls.

  metadata.name   #=> 'mayapp'

See the RDoc API documentation for further specifics.


== HOW TO INSTALL

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install pom

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  $ tar -xvzf pom-1.0.0.tgz
  $ cd pom-1.0.0.tgz
