  body: "TODO: This assumes lib/ is in the load path, and is used to house plugin/. This is of course typical. However it is possible to alter the load path. So it may not always be the case. In the future, it must be decided if we should standardize aroung the lib/ convention (though you could still add others to the load path) or allow it to be complete free form. As I did for bin/, I prefer the former, but have not yet firmly decided."
