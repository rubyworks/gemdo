== Generate POM Metadata from README

Given a README project file containing ...

    = MyApp

    * http://some.org

    == DESCRIPTION

    This is a description of the
    fake project.

    = INSTALL

    To install use RubyGems

      $ gem install myapp

    = LICENSE

    (GPL)

We can generate metadata from the README using the pom command.

    `cd qed/fixtures; pom init README`

Now lets verify the metadata was extracted as expected.

    require 'pom/project'

    project = POM::Project.new('qed/fixtures')

The values should have been picked up from VERSION and PROFILE files.

    project.metadata.title.assert == "MyApp"
    project.metadata.description.assert == "This is a description of the\nfake project."
    project.metadata.license.assert == "GPL"

Clean-up the generated files.

    FileUtils.rm_r('qed/fixtures/VERSION')
    FileUtils.rm_r('qed/fixtures/PROFILE')
    FileUtils.rm_r('qed/fixtures/.cache') if File.exist?('fixture/.cache')
