Considered adding a separate class for build metadata. However, I could
not think of a good place to store this information. The best bet
seemes to to be meta/build/, though that likely means making a special
exlusion in one's package configs, since build data is not needed in
packages but the rest of meta/ is.

On the other hand, it occurs to me that almost all build data would be used
by specific build tools, so it's just as well that each tool handle it's
own configuration needs. The only exception I've thought of is the "build
requirements". So, I've decided to add that field to Metadata itself,
and forego supporting any other build data, at least for the time being.

Thought about adding rubyforge entries to metadata, eg. unixname, groupid, etc.
Putting the difficulty of supporting the use of a rubyforge/ subdirectory in
the meta/ directory to store this information, I've further decided it's not
appropriate information for project metadata. It's really build configuration
and thus should be specified via mechanisms specific to the build tool used,
such a Syckle configs.
