Thought about adding rubyforge entries to metadata, eg. unixname, groupid, etc.
Putting thee difficulty of supporting the use of a rubyforge/ subdirectory in
the meta/ directory to store this information, I've further decided it's not
appropriate information for project metadata. It's really build configuration
and thus should be specified via mechanisms specific to the build tool used,
such a Syckle configs.
